The code in this repository was written in 2019.

I tried to apply the *Clean Architecture* using Kotlin.

## Kotlin is an excellent language that has 100% interoperability with Java.  
The pros which Kotlin has compared with Java are that Kotlin can write code shorter than Java thanks to its features like type inference and expression-oriented.  
And Kotlin keeps the code clean because it focuses on immutability and delegation, not inheritance.  
Letâ€™s apply Kotlin not Java to write the code even if you had already written using Java!(You can compile the code mixed Java and Kotlin!)
